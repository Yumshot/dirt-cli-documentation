# Frequently Asked Questions / Common Fixes

## How do I get the latest version of the CLI?
- The latest version will always be available on npm.js. You can install it with `npm install -g @saiforceone/dirt-cli`

## I get an error when trying to run the CLI
- Make sure you have the latest version of the CLI installed. If you do, try running the command with `sudo` in front of it. If that doesn't work, try running `npm install -g @saiforceone/dirt-cli` again.
- If you're on a linux machine, be sure you have the node, python packages from the official repository installed. You can use pip to install pipenv, but certain distros using community repositories have noticed build failures.
